1. Prediction model
   The file data_office_1.csv serves as our test dataset and can also be used to train the prediction model.
   This link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KXjiYUaeBUwdGpdn4ECwri-P5tG1W-wa?usp=sharing) can be used to download the trained AutoGluon-Tabular model.
   You can also use the code ''1_ML_AutoGluon.ipynb'' to train your own prediction model.

2. Optimization code
   Main code for flexible building space usage named as ''2_Flexible_wall.ipynb''.

Tips

The path specified in the code may need to be updated to match your local environment.
